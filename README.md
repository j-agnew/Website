# Website
The final edition of my website is still a "proof of concept," simply because we're lacking on the band side of things, not that I'm lacking in the design side. The home page contains a brief welcome, but may go on to contain a mailing list form and member bios once are lineup is solid and we ave things to email about. The music page is, well, music - and will be updated with every new song/version of a song. The shows page contains a placeholder poster, but once we have a schedule lined up, will contain a scroll through list of all future shows. The gallery page also contains placeholders that link to dropbox, but will eventually contain specific posters of past shows that link to specific dropbox links filled with archived footage. Finally, the contact page just contains information for anybody interested. I think it's just enough to provide some content and generate interest for the band, and am excited for our plans to get to the point where it can be published online.
