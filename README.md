# Website
I think I'm just about finished besides adding a little more content on the "About" page. This is obviously a band website, broken into 4 categories besides the home page. However, its more of a skeleton for a band site, because we don't have any photos or video from our shows (because we're dumb). The music page contains two demos, but will eventually hold full singles as well as spotify/apple music links for said singles. The Shows page now holds my visual argument as a placeholder, but will eventually be a scroll down list of all upcoming shows in the same format. The Gallery page has 4 placeholders, after a show we will create a public dropbox for all of our own and the audience's photos, clicking on the respective poster will redirect to that link (just the dropbox home page for now). The Contact page is, well, just a contact page. I may try and add a mailing list form but that might be beyond my abilities. Even though the site is a skeleton as far as band use goes, I believe it fulfills the purpose of this project.
