  <p>
    Street Prophets is a new local act started by vocalist Jack Agnew and guitarists Jay Kim and Andy Patton.
    Drawing influence from Shoegaze, Punk, and Indie Rock, we aim to please the ears with more energy than you've ever seen.
    With a few small shows and a debut EP "Keeping Bad Company" on the way, we're preparing to take the next big step into the local Pittsburgh scene, and would love for you to join us.
